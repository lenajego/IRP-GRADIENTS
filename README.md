# SUMMER DIAPAUSE

# About this repository
The R scripts hosted in this repository were developed and used to analyse the effects of climatic variability and biotic interactions on cereal aphids, their parasitoids and hyperparasitoids along longitudinal climatic gradients in Europe and China. These scripts support data processing, statistical analyses and visualization.


# List and description of available scripts and associated databases 
/!\ Each script includes a description of the variables available in the dataset. 

1) Summer_Diapause_Lab_Experiment

The R script provided was developed to analyse the experimental dataset assessing the combined effects of female–female competition and fluctuating thermal stress on summer diapause in the progeny of the cereal aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi. It includes data preparation, computation of diapause, mortality and emergence rates, as well as statistical modelling and graphical visualization of the results. The script is fully reproducible and directly linked to the dataset archived on Zenodo, allowing users to explore how climatic warming and acute heat stress affect parasitoid life-history strategies under controlled laboratory conditions.


2) IRPGRADIENTS_Summer_Diapause_Field_Survey_V5
   
This dataset contains the field data collected in 2022 and 2023 to assess summer diapause incidence in cereal aphid parasitoids along a longitudinal climatic gradient across Europe, from western France to the Czech Republic (~1200 km). Mummies parasitizing cereal aphids were sampled in wheat fields at multiple sites during late spring, and subsequently reared under laboratory conditions to determine diapause incidence, adult emergence rates, and mortality.

3) IRPGRADIENTS_Summer_Diapause_Biot_Abiot
4) 
Additional ecological variables were recorded at each field site, including aphid infestation levels, species abundances, parasitism and hyperparasitism rates but also climatic indexes. This script describes the climatic gradient and evaluates the direct and indirect effects of climate and biotic parameters on the incidence of summer diapause in aphid parasitoids.
