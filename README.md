# IRP-GRADIENTS

# About this repository
The R scripts hosted in this repository were developed as part of my PhD research carried out within the IRP Gradients project. They were used to analyse the effects of climatic variability and biotic interactions on cereal aphids, their parasitoids and hyperparasitoids along longitudinal climatic gradients in Europe and China. These scripts support data processing, statistical analyses and visualization performed throughout my thesis work.

PhD title: Evolution of a cereal aphid guild and their natural enemies along a longitudinal gradient in Europe: influences of climate and landscape, and consequences on BYDV epidemiology (IRP Gradients)

# PhD summary
Environmental stressors act as ecological filters shaping individual responses, population dynamics and trophic interactions. In the context of climate change, their intensification may alter the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. My thesis aimed to understand how biotic and abiotic factors influence the composition of the cereal aphid guild, the structure of the aphid–parasitoid–hyperparasitoid network, and the epidemiology of Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV). Along climatic gradients in Europe and China, we showed that climate — particularly short-term extreme events (heat waves, severe frosts) — better explains population dynamics than other factors. These extremes modify the phenology and reproductive strategies of aphids and parasitoids, with cascading effects on guild structure, biocontrol efficiency and virus transmission.

# List and description of available scripts and associated databases 
Each script includes a description of the variables available in the dataset. 

1) IRPGRADIENTS_Summer_Diapause_Lab_Experiment_2023_LJ

The R script provided was developed to analyse the experimental dataset assessing the combined effects of female–female competition and fluctuating thermal stress on summer diapause in the progeny of the cereal aphid parasitoid Aphidius ervi. It includes data preparation, computation of diapause, mortality and emergence rates, as well as statistical modelling and graphical visualization of the results. The script is fully reproducible and directly linked to the dataset archived on Zenodo, allowing users to explore how climatic warming and acute heat stress affect parasitoid life-history strategies under controlled laboratory conditions.

3) IRPGRADIENTS_Summer_Diapause_Field_Survey_2023_LJ
   
This dataset contains the field data collected in 2022 and 2023 to assess summer diapause incidence in cereal aphid parasitoids along a longitudinal climatic gradient across Europe, from western France to the Czech Republic (~1200 km). Mummies parasitizing cereal aphids were sampled in wheat fields at multiple sites during late spring, and subsequently reared under laboratory conditions to determine diapause incidence, adult emergence rates, and mortality.

3) IRPGRADIENTS_Summer_Diapause_Biot_Abiot_2023_LJ

Additional ecological variables were recorded at each field site, including aphid infestation levels, species abundances, parasitism and hyperparasitism rates but also climatic indexes. This script describes the climatic gradient and evaluates the direct and indirect effects of climate and biotic parameters on the incidence of summer diapause in aphid parasitoids.
