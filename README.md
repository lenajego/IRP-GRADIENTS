# IRP-GRADIENTS

Dataset availability

The dataset used for the analyses presented in this repository is publicly available on Zenodo.

It includes all laboratory experimental results used to assess the combined effects of femaleâ€“female competition and fluctuating thermal stress on the incidence of summer diapause in the parasitoid Aphidius ervi. Parasitoids originated from western France and were reared on their aphid host Sitobion avenae under controlled conditions. During a 30-hour oviposition period, females were exposed to three different fluctuating temperature regimes, representative of current and future climate scenarios, to evaluate resulting diapause incidence, mortality, and adult emergence rates in their offspring.
