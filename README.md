# About this repository
The R scripts hosted in this repository were developed as part of my PhD research carried out within the IRP Gradients project. They were used to analyse the effects of climatic variability and biotic interactions on cereal aphids, their parasitoids and hyperparasitoids along longitudinal climatic gradients in Europe and China. These scripts support data processing, statistical analyses and visualization performed throughout my thesis work.

# PhD summary
Environmental stressors act as ecological filters shaping individual responses, population dynamics and trophic interactions. In the context of climate change, their intensification may alter the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. My thesis aimed to understand how biotic and abiotic factors influence the composition of the cereal aphid guild, the structure of the aphid–parasitoid–hyperparasitoid network, and the epidemiology of Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV). Along climatic gradients in Europe and China, we showed that climate — particularly short-term extreme events (heat waves, severe frosts) — better explains population dynamics than other factors. These extremes modify the phenology and reproductive strategies of aphids and parasitoids, with cascading effects on guild structure, biocontrol efficiency and virus transmission.
