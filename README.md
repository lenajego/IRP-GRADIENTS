# About this repository
The R scripts hosted in this repository were developed as part of my PhD research carried out within the IRP Gradients project. They were used to analyse the effects of climatic variability and biotic interactions on cereal aphids, their parasitoids and hyperparasitoids along longitudinal climatic gradients in Europe and China. These scripts support data processing, statistical analyses and visualization performed throughout my thesis work.

# PhD summary
Environmental stressors act as ecological filters shaping individual responses, population dynamics and trophic interactions. In the context of climate change, their intensification may alter the functioning of agricultural ecosystems. My thesis aimed to understand how biotic and abiotic factors influence the composition of the cereal aphid guild, the structure of the aphid–parasitoid–hyperparasitoid network, and the epidemiology of Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV). Along climatic gradients in Europe and China, we showed that climate — particularly short-term extreme events (heat waves, severe frosts) — better explains population dynamics than other factors. These extremes modify the phenology and reproductive strategies of aphids and parasitoids, with cascading effects on guild structure, biocontrol efficiency and virus transmission.

2) 
This dataset contains the field data collected in 2022 and 2023 to assess summer diapause incidence in cereal aphid parasitoids (Aphidius spp.) along a longitudinal climatic gradient across Europe, from western France to the Czech Republic (~1200 km). Mummies parasitizing cereal aphids were sampled in wheat fields at multiple sites during late spring, and subsequently reared under laboratory conditions to determine diapause incidence, adult emergence rates, and mortality. Additional ecological variables were recorded at each field site, including aphid infestation levels, species abundances, parasitism and hyperparasitism rates. This dataset supports the analysis of how climatic variation (heat waves, precipitation) and biotic interactions shape the expression of summer diapause in natural parasitoid populations.
